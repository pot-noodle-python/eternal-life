He went to save his comrades who were outnumbered. The helicopter couldn't land because of the intense crossfire, so he jumped from the hovering helicopter around 30-50 feet in the air. He then had to run 75 metres to his comrades, where he was shot in the leg, face and head on the way. Once he got there, he started rescuing his squadmates and while he was doing so, got shot in the gut and took a grenade to the back. After all of this, he was miraculously still mobile and still going. Humraj then found out that the helicopter he previously jumped from had crashed so he went and rescued the wounded pilot from the wreckage and proceeded to call in airstrikes and call for another rescue attempt. He was shot in the thigh a couple more times and on his trip to the backup rescue chopper, he was beaten and stabbed by an enemy, who he then killed in hand to hand combat. Once he finally made it back to the chopper, he then allowed his comrades to pull him in. When they arrived back to the base, he was pronounced dead and put into a body bag. As they were zipping up the body bag, he had only the strength to spit to show he was still alive."
